# Module Overview

### Definition

The word Polymorphism is a combination of two Greek words, 
Poly meaning many and Morph meaning forms.

In programming, polymorphism refers to the same object exhibiting different 
forms and behaviors.

For example, take the Shape Class. The exact shape you choose can be 
anything. It can be a rectangle, a circle, a polygon, or a diamond. While,
these are all shapes, their properties are different. This is called
polymorphism.


### What does polymorphism achieve?
In effect, polymorphism cuts down the work of the developer. When the time 
comes to create more specific subclasses with certain unique attributes
and behaviors, the developer can alter the code in the specific areas where 
the responses differ. All other pieces of the code can be left untouched.
