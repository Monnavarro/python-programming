# Module Overview

In OOP, objects and classes are the fundamental entities. Objects are created 
using classes. One can observe that classes contain properties and that 
objects are created to manipulate and access these properties. To make this 
object-oriented system more reliable and error free, it is a good practice to 
limit access to the class members at times.

Information hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of
a class and simply providing an interface through which the outside world 
can interact with the class without knowing whatâ€™s going on inside.

The purpose is to implement classes in such a way that the instances (objects) 
of these classes should not be able to cause any unauthorized access or change 
in the original contents of a class. One class does not need to know anything 
about the underlying algorithms of another class. However, the two can still 
communicate.

### Components of data hiding
Data hiding can be divided into two primary components:

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction

In this module, we will cover the Encapsulation part in detail.
