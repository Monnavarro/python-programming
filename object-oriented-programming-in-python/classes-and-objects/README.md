# Module Overview

This module covers about the world of Object-Oriented Programming.

### Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming, also referred to as OOP, is a programming
paradigm that includes, or relies on, the concept of classes and objects.

The basic idea of OOP is to divide a sophisticated program into a number
of objects that talk to each other.

### Anatomy of objects and classes

Objects may contain data in the form of fields (variables) and methods 
to operate on that data.

Objects are a collection of data and their behaviors.

A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects.
