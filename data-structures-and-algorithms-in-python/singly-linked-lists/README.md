## Structure

Every linked list consists of nodes, as shown in the illustration above.
Every node has two components:

1. Data
2. Next

The data component allows a node in the linked list to store an element
of data that can be of type string, character, number, or any other
type of object. In the illustration above, the data elements are A, B, 
and C which are of character type.

The next component in every node is a pointer that points from
one node to another.

The start of the linked list is referred to as the head. head 
is a pointer that points to the beginning of the linked list, 
so if we want to traverse the linked list to obtain or access an 
element of the linked list, we’ll start from head and move along.

The last component of a singly linked list is a notion of null. 
This null idea terminates the linked list. In Python, we call this None.
The last node in a singly linked list points to a null object, and that 
tells you that it’s the end of the linked list.
