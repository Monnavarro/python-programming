# Module Overview

### Definition

Inheritance provides a way to create a new class from an existing class. 
The new class is a specialized version of the existing class such that it 
inherits all the non-private fields (variables) and methods of the existing 
class. The existing class is used as a starting point or as a base to create 
the new class.

### The Python Object class

The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to  a programmer
to model the real-world objects using a programming language.

In Python,  we create a class, it is, by default, a subclass of the built-in
Python object class. This makes it an excellent example of inheritance in
Python. This class has very few properties and methods, but it does provide 
a strong basis for object-oriented programming in Python.
